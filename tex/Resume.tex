    \section{Education}
        \cventry{2015--Present}{Bachelor of Science in Computer Science}{Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)}{Worcester, MA}{\textit{GPA: 3.98/4.00}}{Minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering}{\textbf{Relevant Coursework:} \textit{Artificial Intelligence, Algorithms, Software Engineering, Object Oriented Design, Database Systems, Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus}}

    \section{Skills}
        \textbf{Languages:} Java, C, Scala, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS\\
        \textbf{Software:} Git, \LaTeX, Eclipse\\ 
        \textbf{Operating Systems:} Linux, MacOS, Windows

    \section{Work Experience}
        \cventry{May 2017--August 2017}{Cyber Analytics and Decision Systems, Research Intern}{MIT Lincoln Laboratory}{Lexington, MA}{}{Conducted research within the space of cyber security visual analytics tools. Developed software infrastructure to aid developers of cyber security visual analytics tools. Implemented new features within an existing cyber security visual analytics tool.}
        
        \cventry{July 2016--August 2016}{Software Engineer Intern}{Analog Devices Incorporated}{Wilmington, MA}{}{Implemented an internet of things solution. Created a custom Bluetooth Low Energy profile to transmit sensor data. Developed an Apache web server to host sensor data. Built an android application to test the robustness of the custom BLE profile. Performed analytical performance tests on the system.}

    \section{Project Experience}
        \cventry{October 2016--December 2016}{Software Engineering (\textit{CS3733})}{LetterCraze}{WPI}{}{Worked on a team of five to develop the LetterCraze application. This game resembles the popular Candy Crush Saga; however, the player is required to find words within a board of letters. Learned software engineering principles of analysis and design in the scope of the entity-boundary-controller design pattern. Served as project leader, a developer, and a tester throughout the course of this project.} 

        \cventry{August 2016--October 2016}{Artificial Intelligence (\textit{CS4341})}{Rubik's Cube Solver}{WPI}{}{Developed a rubik’s cube solver that used IDA* and subgoal decomposition to perform a goal oriented state space search. Conducted independent research of various goal decompositions and their corresponding advantages. Merged multiple decompositions based on their advantages to create a new decomposition capable of solving a Rubik’s Cube 33\% more move efficiently and 93\% more time efficiently than an average human solver. Built with Java.}
